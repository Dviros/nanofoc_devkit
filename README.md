#### Product Description:
Starting your first Field Oriented Control (FOC) project might be daunting, especially if you're new to the field.

As makers, we frequently want to jump right into the action and begin writing the firmware without the hassle/need of selecting the right Microcontroller, Magnetic Sensor, and Motor Driver, then configuring and calibrating it with an abundance of cables that renders your projects too bulky to use in your creations.


The NanoFOC is little enough to attach on the back of most small BLDC gimbal motors (Even easier with Universal BLDC Motor Adapter Kit), making it an excellent choice for compact projects requiring maximum efficiency and precision.

### Power Options:
Device is designed to run of 5V @ 1.5A Max.
There are two ways you can power the board 

1. USB Type C - Power delivery is capped at 5V3A with usage of 5.1K resistors on CC1 and CC2 pads. It is recommended to use USB that is PD2.0 compatible.
It is possible to power device off 500mA capable USB port - however this is not recommended.

2. External VIN  - This connection bypass L1 and  D4 connecting directly to Driver and LDO VS pin. The recommended input voltage is 5V and maximum allowed is 6V - which is restricted by max VIN of ST1L05C LDO.

### First Time Setup
Development Kit comes with no Firmware.
Since ESP32-S3 comes with USB-OTG/USB-Serial integrated into MCU the assumption is that this would be a preferred method of code upload.
If you are connecting your device to computer for the first time it is critical to put device into DFU mode.

**In order to do that you need to:**
1. Connect Development Board to USB port - *On windows machines you may notice that USB detection sound goes on and off in loop - Please ignore that for now*
2. Press and hold **BOOT** switch
3. While holding **BOOT** press and hold **RESET** switch for about **2 seconds**
4. Release **RESET**
5. Release **BOOT**
6. You are now in **DFU mode** and you can use Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to upload your first sketch.

Alternatively you may use UART pins which are available on GPIO Matrix to upload your code the legacy way.
In order to do that you need external TTL Converter.
